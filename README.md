# Assign

This will allow you to use any method inline with multiple assignment.
This is a feature request for the Ruby language [#11690](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11690)

Credit to [Nobuyoshi Nakada](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11690#note-4) for the initial implementation design.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'assign'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install assign

## Usage

```ruby
hash = {x: 123, y: 123}
a, b, hash.assign.update, c = [:a, 2, {y: 456}, nil]
hash
# => {x: 123, y: 456}
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
